six asynchronous tape loops.

i've been seeing tape loops circulating all over the place. sometimes several different loops,
with different sizes, played on a different tape players with different eccentricities. 
i don't have any tapes but i have norns so i decided to try to make digital tape loops: *loooooops*.

this is inspired by musicians like [amulets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER3s1NPr_U), [hainbach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVy9ABT5-iY) and inspired by norns scripts like [reels](https://llllllll.co/t/reels/21030), [cranes](https://llllllll.co/t/cranes), and my previous script [barcode](https://llllllll.co/t/script).

the goal is to have a ui show all six loops simultaneously with their length, rate, and pan information stored in the design on the ui.

### Requirements

- audio input
- norns

### Documentation

- K1 shifts
- K2 stops
- K2 again resets loop
- K3 plays
- shift+K2 clears
- shift+K3 records
- E1 changes loops
- E2 selects parameters
- E3 adjusts parameters

## my other norns

- [barcode](https://github.com/schollz/barcode): replays a buffer six times, at different levels & pans & rates & positions, modulated by lfos on every parameter.
- [blndr](https://github.com/schollz/blndr): a quantized delay with time morphing
- [clcks](https://github.com/schollz/clcks): a tempo-locked repeater for monome norns
