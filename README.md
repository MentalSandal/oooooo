i call this script *"oooooo"* because it is composed of six loops. they are like digital tape loops - you can level, pan, speed, slow, shorten, lengthen, dub, overdub any loop at any time.

i was inspired to make this after seeing tape loops circulating (pun sorta intended) all over the place. i like the idea of having multiple independent different loops, with different sizes, played on a different tape players with different eccentricities. i don't have any cassette tapes but i have norns so i wrote this script to try to make digital tape loops. 

future directions:

- midi cc support for modulating loops
- grid support (need help)
- arc support (need help)
- add lfos for tape *warbling*
- fix all the üêõüêõüêõ

### Requirements

- audio input
- norns

### Documentation

- K1 shifts
- K2 stops
- K2 again resets loop
- K3 plays
- E1 changes loops
- E2 selects parameters
- E3 adjusts parameters
- parameter specific:
- none: shift+K2 resets then clears
- none: shift+K3 primes recording
- none: shift+K3+K3 forces recording
- rate: shift+K2/K3 reverses
- others: shift+K2/K3 toggles lfo

all 114 parameters are availbe via the global menu.

there is a quick menu available on screen which you can navigate. change loops with E1 and change parameters/modes with E2. here's a brief rundown:

**recording:**

- with no parameter selected, press shift+K3 to prime recording. when primed, recording will automatically begin when incoming audio rises above a threshold. the recording threshold can be set by global parameter "`rec thresh`". 
- you can force recording by hitting shift+K3 a second time.
- recording stops after traversing the whole loop. you can stop it earlier with K2 or K3 and that will shrink the loop to that point. you can set recording to continue to the next loop by setting the global parameter "`rec thru loops`" to `yes`.
- by default, volume in "pinched" when starting/stopping recording to avoid pops from discontinuous signals. you can lower/raise the pinching by adjusting the global parameter "`vol pinch`".

**playback:**

- you can adjust the rate in continuous or discrete (¬±25%, ¬±50%, etc.) by changing the global parameter "`continuous rate`"
- when the rate parameter is selected, shift+K2 or shift+K3 reverses direction
- when other parameters are selected, shift+K2 or shift+K3 toggles lfo
- the "`reset every X beats`" allows you to trigger a tape reset every X beats
- the "`warble`" mode allows you to temporarily pitch up/down the current loop using E3

**special functions in A loop:**

if you change the loop to "A" using E1 there are several special functions available to affect all loops.

- K2/K3 stops/plays on *all* loops,
- if no parameter is selected, pressing shift+K2 clears and resets *all* loops
- any other selection is activated by using shift+K2 or shift+K3
- select "save" or "load" to backup or restore to the specified tape (use E3 to change)
- "rand" will randomize parameters, loop sizes, or lfos of *all* loops
- "pause lfos" will toggle pausing of the lfos

## my other norns

- [barcode](https://github.com/schollz/barcode): replays a buffer six times, at different levels & pans & rates & positions, modulated by lfos on every parameter.
- [blndr](https://github.com/schollz/blndr): a quantized delay with time morphing
- [clcks](https://github.com/schollz/clcks): a tempo-locked repeater for monome norns
